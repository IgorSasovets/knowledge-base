## General information

In last article we considered OWASP ZAP vulnerability scanner. In this article we are going to take a look at Burp Suite tool that has
a lot of interesting features and is widely used by security professionals and penetration testers around the world.

Burp or Burp Suite is a graphical tool for testing Web application security. The tool is written in Java and developed by PortSwigger
Security. The tool has two versions: a free version that can be downloaded free of charge (Free Edition) and a full version that can
be purchased after a trial period (Professional Edition). The free version has significantly reduced functionality. It was developed
to provide a comprehensive solution for web application security checks. In addition to basic functionality, such as proxy server,
scanner and intruder, the tool also contains more advanced options such as a spider, a repeater, a decoder, a comparer, an extender
and a sequencer. [Full article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burp_suite).
